    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Typing Speed Test Website is a web-based platform designed to
         help users test, analyze, and improve their typing skills in an 
         easy and interactive way. The main goal of this website is to 
         enhance typing speed, accuracy, and overall keyboard proficiency
          through regular practice and performance tracking.

         Our platform provides users with real-time typing tests, 
         instant calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy
          percentage, and error count. In addition to typing tests, 
          the website also includes a Vocabulary Test module that 
          helps users improve their word knowledge and language 
          skills using a built-in dictionary.
        The system supports secure user registration and login, allowing users to save their test results and monitor progress over time. An admin panel is also available to manage users, typing content, vocabulary questions, and test results efficiently.

        Built using Python (Django Framework) for the backend 
        and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the
        Typing Speed Test Website is fast, reliable, and 
        user-friendly. The platform is suitable for students, 
        professionals, job aspirants, and anyone
        who wants to improve their typing and vocabulary skills.
